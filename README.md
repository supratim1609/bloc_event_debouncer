# 🧠 bloc_event_debouncer

A tiny utility package for Flutter BLoC that helps you **debounce** or **throttle** BLoC events like a boss — because not all user inputs need to go full send.  
Built for performance, cleanliness, and developer sanity. ⚡️

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ `debounce()` — ignore rapid-fire events, keep only the last
- ✅ `throttle()` — fire only once per time window, ignore the rest
- 🎯 Simple BLoC-friendly `EventTransformer<T>`s
- 💡 Clean UX for inputs, sliders, scrolls, and more

---

## 🚀 Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  bloc_event_debouncer: ^0.0.1
